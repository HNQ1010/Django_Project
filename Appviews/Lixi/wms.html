        <ul>
            <h3>&#9733; Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At this time, as the business growing, we need 2 systems serving our operation:</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>&#9755; OPS (Operating system): Serve the operation between departments.</p>
                    <p>&#9755; WMS (Warehouse management system): Control warehouse inventory and streamline warehouse activities.</p>
                </ul>
                <li>In other word, WMS is proportion of OPS, but it is related to main part (company's product) and can raise many issues involving in all departments.</li>
                <li>Based on that, WMS improvement is the urgent task that need to be interested in at this time.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly, As the current warehouse operation flow, the warehouse activities was missing 2 functions of the flow on the system. They are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <p>&#9755; Put away (store) process</p>
                        <p>&#9755; Handover process</p>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The second: WMS functions were hidden in different functions and process directly on that functions.(Receiving is in Buyer function and processes directly in it).</li>
                    <li>The third: A <b>big important </b>thing is Barcode system is not showing on the system in warehouse operation activities. It lead to:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p>&#9755; Missing confirmation between operation processes &rarr; loosen process.</p>
                            <p>&#9755; Many manual processes that lead to make mistake easily in operation (Picking, packing without confirming information on each item, just identify by seeing)</p>
                            <p>&#9755; Staff have to double check for each finished processes.(Re-check picking list by product's name :(( ) &rarr; Cause of workload.</p>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>&#9733; Next steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As discussion with team and your suggestion to pick some most important features that need to improve. I'd like to show you steps as belows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li style="color:red">Step 1: Assign PIC to contact when we are starting project. We need a person that deeply understand and keep following our needs to make corresponding between system and warehouse operation.</li>
                    <li style="color:red">Step 2: Gathering warehouse management system as one function and separating each function as warehouse operation flow.</li>
                    <img src="{% static 'IMG/Lx_operation_flow4.png' %}" style="width: 100%">
                    <li>Step 3: Apply/ show product's barcode on the system.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: After finishing above steps, and as the priorities in built-in these functions/ features. I'd like to focus on improving the Outbound operation. The features are:</li>
