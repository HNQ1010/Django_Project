    <p>An hour sleep in the middle of the day can work wonders.</p>
    <p>Finally, vindication for power nappers. Far from being lazy louts, siesta-takers are actually doing their bit for the firm. According to Sara Mednick and<br>
    her colleagues at Harvard, just 60 minutes of shit-eue in the middle of the day can make you perform like the fresh daisy int the morning. But it has to be<br>
    bona fide sleep; a mere rest, they found, has no effect.</p>
    <p>Dr.Mednick, whose results have just been published in Nature Neuroscience, wanted to know what effect power napping would have on people's visual perception.<br>
    <p>She asked 30 student volunteers to come into her laboratory. Four times on the same day, at 9 am, noon, 4 pm and 7 pm, they were required to stare at a computer<br>
    screen for an hour. Their task was to pick out a vertical or horizontal bar from a striped background--an established test of visual perceptiveness. The more<br>
    quickly they picked out the bar, the more acute their perception.</p>
    <p>All the volunteers had slept will in the days before the rest, and had been warned off alcohol. During the test day, nicotine addicts were allowed to indulge<br>
    their habits, but everyone had to remain uncaffeinated. Despite this cosseting, the performance of the ten volunteers who went straight through the day without<br>
    a nap deteriorated rapidly. Their best scores were first thing in the morning, and it was downhill from there on. By the last session, they were taking 52% longer<br>
    on average, to identify the orientation of the bar than they had in the first.</p>
    <p>However, another ten of the volunteers were given the opportunity to nap at 2 pm for 30 minutes, while the remaining ten were allowed a 60-minute snooze. The short<br>
    nappers did not get any worse in their afternoon test sessions. The long nappers actually got better--they performed just as well as they had first thing.</p>
    <p>To test whether a rest rather than a nap, would do the trick, nine more volunteer were asked in. But to no avail: their abilities declined with each session.<br>
    Nor did motivation seem to be a factor. Yet another set of volunteers, after a poor showing in the second session, was told they had not done very well, bit that<br>
    they could earn a further $25 if they could do as well in the afternoon as they had that morning. The poor students' eyes lit up, according to Dr Mednick, but not<br>
    one, alas, was able to stop the decay.</p>
    <p>The upshot is another piece of evidence that humans, like many mammals which have evolved in tropical climes, are adapted not to go out in the mid-day sun. They are,<br>
    rather, crepuscular--that is, they are most active in the morning and the evening. The protestant work ethic that drives those now living in colder climates to work<br>
    throughout the day may actually be counterproductive. At least, that is what you should tell your boss when asking for a couch to be installed in the office.</p>
