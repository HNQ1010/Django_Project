<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue">What's Your Learning Mode?</h1>
    <ul>
        <p>Which style best sums you up as a person?</p>
        <p>"That looks good to me."</p>
        <p>"That sounds good to me."</p>
        <p>"That feels good to me."</p>
        <p>Experts say that these cues suggest a person's learning modality.</p>
        <p>The first expression reflects a visual person. The second an auditory person. The third a kinesthetic person.</p>
        <p>It simply means that a visual person learns through seeing, an auditory person learns through hearing and a kinesthetic person learns through moving, doing and touching.<br>
            To help you understand the three learning modes better, here are additional cues used by learners of different styles.</p>
        <p>The visual person might say such things รก "it appears to me", 'bird's eye view", "pretty as a picture", "catch a glimpse of", "hazy ideas", "eye to eye", and "the mind's eye".</p>
        <p>The auditory person might say such things as "we are all ears", "it's clear as a bell", "it rings a bell", "describe in detail", "voice an opinion", "unheard of".</p>
        <p>The kinesthetic person might say such things as"hang in there", "come to grips with", "lay your cards on teh table", "start from scratch", "too much hassle", "get in touch<br>
            with", "pull some strings".</p>
        <p>If you know your boss is a visual person, would you voice your opinion or would you get your point across using visual materials such as  slides and easy-to-read handouts?</p>
        <p>If you know that a colleague is a kinesthetic person who tends to speak slowly, maybe you could slow down to create a better understanding and rapport.</p>
        <p>If you find that college students are fumbling in your class even though they did well in high school, wouldn't you want to find out why in order to teach more effectively?</p>
        <p>Perhaps there're conflict between the students; preferred learning mode and your teaching style. Perhaps the majority of your students are visual learners and you are a<br>
            mostly auditory teacher.</p>
        <p>Remember how we learned as kids? We learned faster through visual and kinesthetic modes. It's important to find out your personal learning mode and that of your family<br>
            members and key contacts in your company. If you are a teacher or a trainer, and it's difficult to cater to each learning mode, a good method is to combine visual, auditory<br>
            and kinesthetic modes in your teaching.</p>
        <p>So what's your learning mode?</p>
        <p>Allow me to describe these modes from teh book, "quantum Learning" by Bobbi Deporter and Mike Hernacky. If you are a visual person, you are observant, can see words in your<br>
            mind, remember more of what was seen than heard, memorize by visual association, read and speak fast, would rather read tha nbe read to, eed an overall view and purpose,<br>
            doodle during phone conversations and meetings, like art more han music and often forget to relay verbal messages to to others.</p>
        <p>If you are an auditory person, you talk to yourself while working, enjoy reading aloud and listening, are better at telling than writing, are an eloquent speaker, remember<br>
            what was discussed rather than see,, go into lengthy discussions, like jokes better than comics, like music more than art and speak at an average speed in rhythmic patterns.</p>
        <p>If you are kinesthetic person, you speak slowly, respond to physical rewards, touch people to get their attention, move a lot ,learn by doing, memorize by walking and seeing,<br>
            use a inger as a pointer when reading, gesture a lot, use action words, like to be involved in games, want to act things out and like plot-oriented books that have action.</p>
        <p>This does not mean that we do not learning all of these modalities. We do. It's just that we prefer one over the other. Knowing your style can help you learn faster and easier.<br>
            Knowing how to decipher the learning styles of others will help you strengthen your rapport with them and help them learn more effectively, too.</p>
