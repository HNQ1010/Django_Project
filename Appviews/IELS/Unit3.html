<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue">The Interesting Lore of April Fools' Day</h1>
<ul>
    <p>The first of April is a special day, on which practical jokes may be played without punishment. The origin of the<br>
    custom is uncertain, but it seems to have come about in France as a result of change to the Gregorian calendar in 1582.<br>
    In sixteenth-century France, the start of the new yar was observed on April first. Ut was celebrated in much the same<br>
    way as it is today with parties and dancing into the late hours of the night. Then in 1582, Pope Gregory introduced a<br>
    new calendar for the Christian world, and the new year fell on January first. There were some people, however, who<br>
    hadn't heard or didn't believe the change in the date, so they continued to celebrate New Tear's Day on April first.<br>
    Others played tricks on them and called them "April Fools". They sent them on a "fool's errand" ·ªè tried to make them<br>
    believe that something false was true.</p>
    <p>In France today, children fool their friends by taping a paper fish to their friends' backs. When the 'young fool'<br>
    discovers this trick, the prankster yell 'April Fish!'. Today Americans play small tricks on friends and strangers<br>
    alike on the same day. One common trick is pointing down to a friend's shoe and saying, 'Your shoelace is untied!'.<br>
    Teachers in the nineteenth century used to say to pupils, 'Look! A flock of geese!' and point up. School children<br>
    might tell a classmate that school has been canceled. Whatever the trick, if the innocent victim falls for the joke<br>
    the prankster yells, 'April Fool!'.</p>
    <p>The 'fool's errands' we play on people are practical jokes. Filling the sugar bowl with salt, stuffing a biscuit<br>
    with cotton and offering an empty egg shell at breakfast, are good old tricks. Some practical jokes are kept up the<br>
    whole day before the victim realizes what day it is. Most April Fool jokes are in good fun and not meant to harm<br>
    anyone. The most clever April Fool joke is the one where everyone laughs, especially the person upon whom the joke<br>
    is played.</p>
    <p>There are also April Fool letters. They are composites of prankishness, deception, absurdity folk verses, and love.<br>
    The letter are never signed, but girls, apparently, make a game of trying o guess who send them. To receive an April<br>
    Fool letter during April, for it can be sent anytime during the month, is deemed a most flattering honor and the<br>
    contents are shared among envious acquaintances.</p>
    <p>April Fool tricks are not, it seems, confined to children. People play tricks in the office. Faking phone calls,<br>
    issuing tickets for nonexistent parties, and creating bomb scares are all elaborate pranks. The story of a salesman<br>
    in Rhode Island is said to be the worst trick on April Fools' Day. He had been fooling around with secretary. He was<br>
    married and everyone in the office knew about it. The girl was a bit crazy, a real screwball, and one of the other<br>
    salesmen persuaded her to tell her boyfriend she was pregnant as an April Fool joke. She went in his office and left<br>
    the door open so everyone could hear her. Her words did make him a little crazy. He thought it was a big joke. Maybe<br>
    he was happy it was an April Fool joke. But he just laughed and kept right on going around with her.</p>
