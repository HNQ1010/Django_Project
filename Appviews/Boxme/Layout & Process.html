    <p><b>Notice: </b>Pre-receiving is the process when order was finished and handed over to 3PL and has to complete
    before receiving.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Matching information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Receive and check receipts.</li>
        <li>Record information : license, Vendor, time ... </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2: Quality and Quantity check:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Process in turn and separately for each Vendor.</li>
        <li>Unload and receive products.</li>
        <li>Ensure that there're no damaged goods and exact number of products received.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3: Receive and update on the sys:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scan and update order status on the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 4: Allocating and putting away of Inventory:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After checking successfully, the product is barcoded to be easily located within the facility and quickly
            packed so that there're minimal delays in order processing.</li>
            <li>Sort, classify exactly the type of products and put away inside warehouse on the corrected positions
            and WH labels.</li>
            <li>Current WH labels:</li>
            <pre>
                Area    row     bay     level   pos
                   A   -   01  -   01   -   3   -   A
            </pre>
        </ul>
    <h3>Step 5: Confirm with related Teams:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:red">Sign, store documentations and update information to relevant teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 1: Order management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Order management dictates the product picking, packing and labeling activities per each
        newly received customer order.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2: Picking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preparing order checklist.</li>
        <li>Based on order descriptions(item SKUs, product colors, size, number of units,... and location inside
        warehouse, pick the requested items exactly.</li>
        <li>On time.(Based on real operations, calculate the employee productivity, performance).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3: Packing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sign and save handover records.</li>
        <li>Choose suitable materials to achieve the lowest practical dimensional weight in order to optimize
        dimensional weight, increase handover volume and save costs.</li>
        <li>Return shipping materials and labels in case customer wishes to exchange or return the item for a refund
        later.</li>
        <li>After finishing packing process, stick label to it's package exactly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 4: Weight Measurement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Weight the orders or record number of orders and order's dimensional to measure the volumetric weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 5: Shipping</h3>
    <p>After finishing packing process, the order is sent to a transportation channel or shipping node to be 
    shipped to the customer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Validate orders, check for errors or duplications, and handle exceptions immediately.</li>
        <li>Prepare handover documentations.</li>
        <li>Based on 3PL's information, tailoring picking capabilities and strategies.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Line picking.</li>
            <li>Cluster picking.</li>
            <li>Batch picking.</li>
            <li>Zone picking.</li>
            <li>Label-based picking.</li>
            <li>Paper-based picking.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Hand over orders to correct shipper or carrier and ensure on-time information on sys.</li>
        <li>Sign and save handover records.</li>
        <li>Keep updating shipping process.</li>
    </ul>

    <legend><h2>Stage 3: Reverse Logistic</h2></legend>
    <img src="{% static 'IMG/reverse-logisticsflow.jpg'%}">
    <h3>Step 1: Process the Return</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting when the consumer signals they want to return a product.</li>
        <li>Scheduling return shipments and identifying where the product should go.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 2: Deal with Returns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check return authorization and product's conditions.</li>
        <li>Inspect return products and determine its return category.</li>
        <li>Sort products into disposition options:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix</li>
            <li>Resell as new</li>
            <li>Resell as a return</li>
            <li>Repair, recycle, replacement, ...</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 3: Keep Return moving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After identifying the type of return products, keep moving it to the correct locations or functions 
        (repair, recycle, ...) to reduce daily waste.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Customer KPIs: Related to Express Companies</h1>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>1. On-time Shipping</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition</b>The ratio of orders that were shipped on or before the requested shipping date versus the
        total number of orders.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Orders shipped on time or early ÷ Total # of orders shipped
        </pre>
        <li><b>Meaning: </b>This KPI tells you how effective you are with getting shipments out on time. If your on-time
        shipping metric is too low, it means that orders are not being picked, packaged, and shipped in an acceptable of
        amount time, and you need to address the issue or risk customer dissatisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>2. Order Cycle Time</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>The average length of time it takes from when a customer places an order until they receive it.</li>
        <li>Formula:</li>
        <pre>
            (Time the order was received by customer – Time the order was placed) ÷ Total number of orders shipped
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: Order cycle time lets you know how effective your warehouse is at fulfilling and shipping customer
        orders. When your average order cycle time is lengthening, you may need to address other areas, like invoicing
        times, supplier lead times, and accounts payable or receivable, to resolve issues and lower the amount of time
        between order and delivery.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>3. Internal Order Cycle Time</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li>Definition: The average length of time from when an order is taken until it is shipped.</li>
        <li>Formula:</li>
        <pre>
             (Time the order is ready to ship – Time the order was placed) ÷ Total # of orders
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The internal order cycle time metric is similar to the order cycle time metric, but without the
        time that it takes the shipping carrier to deliver the order included. If your average time is growing, then you
        should look at your picking and packaging processes.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>4. Perfect Order Percentage</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>This KPI is the percentage of orders that move through the fulfillment process with no errors
        or deviations. It includes taking the order correctly, allocating inventory immediately, delivering undamaged products
        on time with an accurate invoice.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            (Percent of orders on time) X (Percent of orders shipped complete) X (Percent of orders shipped no damage) X (Percent of orders with correct documentation)
        </pre>
        <li>To determine the KPIs included in the above formula uses the following calculations:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Percent of orders on time = Orders on time versus Total orders</li>
            <li>Percent of orders shipped complete = Orders shipped complete versus Total orders</li>
            <li>Percent of orders shipped no damage = Orders shipped with no damage versus Total orders</li>
            <li>Percent of orders with correct documentation = Orders with correct documentation versus Total orders</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Meaning: The perfect order percentage KPI can get pretty complicated, but it provides useful information. It 
        tells you what percentage of orders are being processed accurately and on time. When you see this number decreasing,
        it’s time to take a look at your processes and who is doing the processing.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>5. Order Picking Accuracy</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>The accuracy of the order-picking process.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Total # of orders ÷ Perfect order rate
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The order picking accuracy KPI is important because it lets you know the percentage of orders that are
        picked for shipping accurately. If your order picking accuracy percentage goes down, then you may have problems with
        inventory, shipping time, returns, and of course, dissatisfied customers.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<h1>Operations KPIs: Inside Warehouse</h1>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>1. Order Fill Rate Percentage</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>Order fill rate tracks the percentage of orders successfully delivered on the first attempt.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Percent of orders delivered on the 1st attempt ÷ Total orders
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The order fill rate percentage is another in full KPI that should be tracking at a high number. If
        it isn’t close to 100%, you should investigate why, beginning with inventory management, supply-chain lead time,
        packaging process, and shipping carriers.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>2. Line Item Fill Rate Percentage</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>Line fill rate percentage is an indicator of how you are stocking products that are in
        demand from customers.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Number of customer order lines filled completely ÷ Total #of customer order lines shipped
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The line item fill rate metric allows you to see if your product demand is being met. A low percentage
        for this metric may mean that your demand planning and forecasting are not accurate, you have issues with inventory
        management, problems with vendor management, or inventory shrinkage problems.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>3. Orders Picked per Hour</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>The productivity of each worker over a specific hour.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Orders picked and shipped ÷ Total hours in picking and shipping
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The orders picked per hour metric allows you to quantify each worker’s productivity in a certain
        time frame. When tracked, you can see which employees have an acceptable output and which don’t.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<h1>Warehouse KPIs</h1>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>1. Dock to Stock Time</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>This metric measures the time from the start of a receipt (incoming inventory) to the time
        that put-away is complete.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Time received inventory is put away – Time incoming inventory was received
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: The dock-to-stock cycle begins when your warehouse receives delivery of goods from the supplier and
        ends when those goods are put away in the warehouse and recorded into the inventory management system. If the 
        average length of time is too long, or continually increasing, receiving processes will need to be investigated
        and addressed.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>2. Inventory Accuracy</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Definition: </b>Inventory accuracy allows you to compare stock quantities in your inventory management 
        system with the actual physical inventory on the shelves.</li>
        <li>Formula: </li>
        <pre>
            Database inventory count ÷ Physical inventory count
        </pre>
        <li>Meaning: Your physical inventory should match that listed in your system. However, there’s often a discrepancy
        in large distribution centers. A high rate of inaccuracy in inventories can lead to unexpected backorders, customer
        dissatisfaction and, ultimately, higher overall costs.</li>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<h1>Key Processes</h1>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>Picking Process</h2></legend>
    <ul>
        <li>Order picking goals:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimize travel distance: Picking path design.</li>
            <li>Maximize use of space: layout design.</li>
            <li>Minimize pick errors: order return process (explore more...).</li>
            <li>Minimize injuries: safe working environment (arranging, travelling, equipment, ...)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <legend><h2>Packing</h2></legend>
    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Materials costs are not the only contributing factor to packaging expenses. In fact, there are several factors
        that increase packing costs.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Poorly designed materials storage and packing lines.</li>
            <li>Long packing process times.</li>
            <li>Paying for box dimensions rather than product dimensions.</li>
            <li>Ineffective packing materials that allow damage.</li>
            <li>Inefficient manufacturing models.</li>
            <li>Failing to optimize packing.</li>
            <li>Expensive shipping costs.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Improving Materials: There is a wide variety of packaging materials available and variations within each
        category.</li>
        <li>2. Improving Packing Lines: Packaging Lines: Consider the layout of warehouse.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Analyze current inventory of product packing.</li>
            <li>2. Identify similar items that could be grouped together.</li>
            <li>3. Identify infrequently used packing materials and group them together.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>3. Optimize Packaging by Using Smaller Boxes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximize packing space: Ship as many products as possible in one packing box.</li>
            <li>Diversify packaging materials: Rather than using the same three box sizes, evaluate average shipment size
            and ensure appropriate packaging that doesn’t cost through the dimensional volume rate.</li>
            <li>Use padded envelopes: Some of products may be small enough to go into large, padded envelopes rather than
            small boxes.</li>
            <li>Negotiate shipping rates: Review shipping data to understand shipping profile before entering into
            negotiations with carrier.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>4. Minimize Returns by Ensuring Products are Properly Packaged and Transported: improving poor packaging and
        transit damage.</li>
        <li>Rethink, redesign and keep improving packing process.</li>
    </ul>
